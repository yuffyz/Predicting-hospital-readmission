# Predicting Hospital Readmission Rates Using Machine Learning Algorithms

This project aims to predict whether a diabetes patient will be readmitted within 30 days of discharge. Different machine learning models and ensemble methods are applied to train this data.

The final chosen model is an ensemble of multinomial naive bayes, gradient boosting and random forest with around 60% recall for both class 1 and class 0. 


## Dataset 

The Dataset is [Diabetes 130-US hospitals for years 1999-2008 Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Diabetes+130-US+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008) provided by Virgina Commonwealth University (VCU) to the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
